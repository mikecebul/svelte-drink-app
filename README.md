# My Drink App
Click the button and get a random drink idea with instructions and ingredients!
### Framework
This was built with Sveltekit and Tailwindcss. It uses a Drink API from https://www.thecocktaildb.com/.
### Plans
In the future I will be including a rating system by storing data to a postgreSQL database with Prisma.
### Inspiration
This idea was taken from Weibenfalk and James Q Quick on YouTube.

### Demo App
https://svelte-prisma.vercel.app/

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
